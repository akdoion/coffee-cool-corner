The purpose of the coffee house does sometimes take on the purpose of the centre of society. <br><br>
Your visit could be to meet up or gossip with your friends, do some works, read a book, entertain, or simply to just pass some time. <br><br>
It can be one place that will be a great meeting ground.<br><br>
Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels
That's because it contains a stimulant called caffeine — the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world . 
After you drink coffee, the caffeine is absorbed into your bloodstream.<br><br>
“Caffeine is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about coffee. But coffee also contains antioxidants and other active
 substances that may reduce internal inflammation and protect against disease,” 
says Diane Vizthum, M.S., R.D., research nutritionist for Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine<br><br>
Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. <br><br>
When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried.<br><br>
 Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. <br><br>
Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee<br><br>
